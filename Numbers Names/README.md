Create a console program that converts a numeric input into its corresponding word representation. Here's how you can construct the program:
1.	Read an Integer Input: The program should read an integer value from the console and store it in a variable.
2.	Convert to Word: Use a series of conditional statements (if, else if) to match the value of num with its corresponding word representation.
3.	Check the following conditions:
•	If num is 1, display "one" on the console.
•	If num is 2, display "two" on the console.
•	If num is 3, display "three" on the console.
•	If num is 4, display "four" on the console.
•	If num is 5, display "five" on the console.
•	If num is 6, display "six" on the console.
•	If num is 7, display "seven" on the console.
•	If num is 8, display "eight" on the console.
•	If num is 9, display "nine" on the console.
•	If num is 10, display "ten" on the console.
•	If num is none of the above, display "number out of range" on the console.
