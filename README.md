Skills Acquired in Programming fundamentals and Unit testing
Skills Acquired
Component Testing (Unit Testing)

    During the course, I gained a thorough understanding of component testing, often referred to as unit testing. This practice involves testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation to ensure their correctness. I learned to write unit tests to verify the behavior of specific code units and how to use testing frameworks and tools for this purpose.

Working with the Standard Functionality of the Programming Language

    The course provided me with hands-on experience working with the standard functionality and libraries of the programming language we focused on. This involved using built-in functions, data types, and language-specific features to solve various programming challenges.

Working with Linear Data Structures

    I learned about the fundamental concept of linear data structures, which include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. These data structures are essential for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. I gained practical experience in implementing and using these data structures in different scenarios.

Declaring and Invoking Methods

    One of the core skills I acquired is the ability to declare and invoke methods or functions within a program. I learned how to encapsulate code into reusable functions, enabling modular and efficient code organization.

Working with Fundamental Concepts of Automated Testing

    Automated testing is a crucial practice in modern software development. In the course, I was introduced to the fundamental concepts of automated testing, including writing test cases, test suites, and integrating testing into the development workflow. I also learned about test automation tools and frameworks.
