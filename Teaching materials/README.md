The school year has already started and the 10B grade manager - Annie has to buy a certain number of packets of pens, packets with markers, as well as board cleaner. She is a regular client of a bookstore, so there is a discount for her, which represents some discount percentage of the total amount.  Write a program that calculates how much money Annie will need to collect to pay the bill, keeping in mind the following price list: 
•	Package of pens - 5.80 lv. 
•	Package of markers - 7.20 lv. 
•	Board cleaner - 1.20 BGN (per liter)
Input
From the console read 4 numbers:
•	Number of packages of pens - integer in the range [0...100]
•	Number of packets of markers - integer in the range [0...100]
•	Liters of board cleaner - an integer in the range [0... 50]
•	Discount percentage - integer in the range [0...100]
