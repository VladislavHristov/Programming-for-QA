#Programming-For-QA
In a cinema hall, the chairs are arranged in a rectangular shape with r-rows and c-columns. There are three types of screenings with tickets at different prices:
•	Premiere – premiere screening, at a price of 12.00 leva.
•	Normal – standard screening, at a price of 7.50 leva.
•	Discount – screening for children and students at a reduced price of 5.00 leva.
Write a program that reads the type of screening (string), the number of rows and the number of columns in the hall (integers) entered by the user, and calculates the total ticket revenue at a full hall. The result should be presented in a format similar to the examples provided, showing 2 decimal places.
