# Programming-for-QA
Create a console program that classifies animals based on their types. Here's how you can construct the program:
1. Read Animal Input: The program should read a text value from the console and store it in the variable "animal".
2. Classify The Animal: Use a switch statement to match the input value with the corresponding animal type. 
3. Check the following conditions:
* If the animal is "dog", display "mammal" on the console.
* If the animal is "crocodile", "tortoise", or "snake", display "reptile" on the console.
* If none of the above cases match, display "unknown" on the console.
