#Programming for QA

For his birthday, Lyubomir received an aquarium in the shape of a parallelepiped. Initially, we read from the console in separate rows its dimensions – length, width and height in centimeters. It is necessary to calculate how many liters of water the aquarium will collect, if it is known that a certain percentage of its capacity is occupied by sand, plants, heater and pump. 
One liter of water is equal to one cubic decimeter (1 l = 1 dm3). 
Write a program that calculates the liters of water that are needed to fill the aquarium.
Input
From the console read 4 lines:
1.	Length in cm – an integer number in the range [10 ... 500]
2.	Width in cm – an integer number in the range [10 ... 300]
3.	Height in cm – an integer number in the range [10... 200]
4.	Percentage – floating point number in the range [0.000 ... 100.000]
