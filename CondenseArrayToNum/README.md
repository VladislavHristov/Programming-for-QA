#Programming-For-QA /n
Write a program that:
•	Read a sequence of integer numbers from the console
•	Condense them by summing adjacent couples of elements until a single integer is obtained
Example: If we have 3 elements {2, 10, 3}. We sum the first two and the second two elements and obtain 
	           {2+10, 10+3} = {12, 13}. Then we sum again all adjacent elements and obtain {12+13} = {25}.
