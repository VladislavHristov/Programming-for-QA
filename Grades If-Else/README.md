# Programming-for-QA
Write a console program that reads a grade value (floating point number) as input from the console. The program should then evaluate the grade and display appropriate messages based on the following conditions:
•	If the entered grade is equal to or greater than 5.50, the program should display "Excellent!"
•	If the entered grade is less than 5.50, the program should display "Not excellent.”
