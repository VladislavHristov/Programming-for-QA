Create a console program that identifies the name of a day based on a numeric input. Here's how you can construct the program:
1. Read an Integer Input: The program should read an integer value from the console and store it in the variable "day".
2. Convert to Word: Use a switch statement to match the value of the day with the corresponding week’s day name. 
3. Check the following conditions:
* If day is 1, display "Monday" on the console.
* If day is 2, display "Tuesday" on the console.
* If day is 3, display "Wednesday" on the console.
* If day is 4, display "Thursday" on the console.
* If day is 5, display "Friday" on the console.
* If day is 6, display "Saturday" on the console.
* If day is 7, display "Sunday" on the console.
