#Programming-For-QA
Write a program to check if given number is special: 
•	Special numbers are divisible by all of their digits without remainder
•	Reads an integer number and check whether it is a special number
•	If the number IS special print: "{num} is special"
•	If the number is NOT special print: "{num} is not special"
Note: There will not be numbers with digit 0 in them.
