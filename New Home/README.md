#Programming-For-QA
Martin and Nelly are buying a new house not far from Sofia. 
Nelly loves flowers so much that she convinces you to write a program to calculate how much it will cost them, 
to plant a certain number of flowers and whether the available budget will be enough for them. 
Different flowers come at different prices.

The following discounts exist:
•	If Nelly buys more than 80 Roses - 10% discount from the final price
•	If Nelly buys more than 90 Dahlias - 15% discount from the final price
•	If Nelly buys more than 80 Tulips - 15% discount from the final price
•	If Nelly buys less than 120 Narcissus - the price is increased by 15%
•	If Nelly buys less than 80 Gladiolus - the price in increased by 20%
Three lines should be read from the console:
•	Type of flowers - text with options - "Roses", "Dahlias", "Tulips", "Narcissus", "Gladiolus"
•	Flowers count - an integer in the range [10... 1000]
•	Budget - an integer in the range [50... 2500]
Print the result on the console on a single line:
•	If their budget is enough - "Hey, you have a great garden with {flowersCount} {flowersType} and {sumLeft} leva left."
•	If their budget is NOT enough, "Not enough money, you need {neededMoney} leva more."
The sum should be formatted to the second decimal place.
