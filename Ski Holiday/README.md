Atanas decided to spend his vacation in Bansko and go skiing. Before he goes, however, he must book a hotel and calculate how much his stay will cost. The following types of accommodation are available, each with its corresponding prices for stay:
	"room for one person" - 118.00 BGN per night
	"apartment" - 155.00 BGN per night 
	"President Apartment" – 235.00 BGN per night
Based on the number of days he plans to stay in the hotel (example: 11 days = 10 nights) and the type of room he chooses, he may be eligible for various discounts. 

The available reductions are as follows:

After the stay, Atanas' assessment of the hotel's services can be positive or negative.  If his assessment is "positive", Atanas adds 25% of it to the price with the already deducted discount. If his assessment is "negative", he deducts 10% from the price.
