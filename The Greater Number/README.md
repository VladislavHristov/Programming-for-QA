# Programming-for-QA
Create a console program that compares two integer values and determines the greater number. Follow these steps to create the program:
1.	Read Two Integer Inputs: The program should read two integer values from the console and store them in variables num1 and num2 respectively.
2.	Compare the Numbers: Utilize a series of conditional statements (if, else if, and else) to compare the values of num1 and num2. Check the following conditions:
•	If num1 is greater than num2, display "Greater number: [num1]" on the console.
•	If num1 is less than num2, display "Greater number: [num2]" on the console.
•	If num1 is equal to num2, display "The two numbers are equal." on the console.
