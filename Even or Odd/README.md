# Programming-for-QA
Create a console program that assesses whether a given integer is odd or even. The program should follow these steps:
1.	Read an Integer Input: The program should read a value from the console using the Console.ReadLine() method. Convert the input to an integer using int.Parse() and store it in the variable num.
2.	Evaluate if the Integer is Even or Odd: Use a conditional statement (if-else) to check if the value of num is evenly divisible by 2. To do this, calculate num % 2 (the remainder when dividing num by 2). If the remainder is 0, it means num is even; if the remainder is 1, it means num is odd.
3.	Display the Result: If num is even (the remainder is 0), use Console.WriteLine() to print "even" on the console. 
If num is odd (the remainder is 1), use Console.WriteLine() to print "odd" on the console.
